# TODO-List
To-Do List Console-Based Application :
A simple  yet efficient command-line to-do list manager written in Python.

tasks.txt — An auto-created file to store the tasks.
Features include:
Add new tasks
View current tasks
Remove tasks by number
Persistent storage in a local tasks.txt file
Runs entirely in the terminal / command line.
